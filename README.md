# iptables_blocker
Hey guys, I hope y'all are doing well. I'm back with another script that will help you respond to incidents.
This script will block the specified IP from accessing your important services.
  like :
-http
-https
-ftp
-telnet
-ssh 
-pop3 
##usage : 
```bash
./iptables {ip_blocked]

##install the script : 
```bash  
git clone https://https://github.com/badrchoukri/iptables_blocker.git
